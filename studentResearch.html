                    <h2>2020-2025 - Deep Learning for PV Identification</h2>
                    <p>Many rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation facilities are installed behind-the-meter, and so it can be difficult for researchers to access detailed data about the scale and growth of distributed PV generation. The wide availability of satellite and aerial imagery provides a potential solution to this problem. Employing Deep Neural Networks, which have been employed for a variety of computer vision applications, we can try to identify rooftop PV systems from aerial images. This project is in collaboration with German researchers from DLR. In 2025, we published a complete dataset of labeled imagery for <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15084215">Queens, NY</a>.

                    <h2>2020 - Improved Mixer Designs for Wastewater Treatment in Hazleton</h2>
                    <p>A team of students worked to provide a solution to local non-profit, Can Do, to improve reliability in the wastewater treatment facility in the Humboldt Industrial Park. Submerged mixers operate continuously to keep sediment suspended within the plant's anoxic tanks. The opertators had observed that these mixers were prone to failure. Our students researched a variety of potential solutions in use by other operators, and developed a recommendation using mixers whose drive motors were held out of the water to help the plant avoid frequent downtime. Students had to ensure that the mixers would still provide equivalent stirring and suspension of the solids so that the tank could continue to experience efficient treatment of the water.

                    <p>Small electrical grids are much more sensitive to the variability associated with solar generation. Consequently, in some cases, regulations require that any renewable generation be isolated from the grid as a whole. A group of students worked in conjunction with EnergyIQ to design a microgrid for a resort in Turks and Caicos. Students carefully planned interconnection and energy storage systems to ensure that inexpensive, renewable power could be delivered to critical systems.

                    <p>The Big Spring is a historic landmark in downtown Bellefonte, PA. One of our senior design teams worked with representatives of the Borough of Bellefonte to design an improved cover that would help return the spring to its beloved appearance, while still allowing it to deliver safe drinking water to the public. Students worked closely with members of the Borough Council and the public to find a solution.

                    <h2>2019 - Backup Power to Support Individuals with Disabilities</h2>
                    <p>Power blackouts may disproportionately affect those with disabilities, who rely on a variety of electronic devices to manage their lives. These needs may range from tablets that provide comfort and stability to individuals with intellectual disabilities, to things like door openersm stair lifts, or charging for electric wheelchairs, for those with physical disabilities. A group of students paired with the Anthracite Centers for Independent Living (ARCIL) to design a backup power system to support these individuals through a power outage. <a href="https://hazleton.psu.edu/feature/powering-through-challenge"> Read More </a></p>

                    <p>Play is developmentally important for children, but it may be difficult for children with a variety of
                        physical impairments to manipulate off-the-shelf toy items. Modifications to enable greater access
                        to these toys require only inexpensive parts and simple electronics work. A group of students has
                        worked to modify toys for use by these children.</p>

                    <h2>2018 - Trash Retrieval System for Steep Terrain</h2>
                    <p>The Borough of Jim Thorpe experiences frequent illegal dumping of tires, electronics and other large
                        items along Flagstaff Road, which is bordered by steep hillsides. Volunteers participate in trash
                        removal, but their efforts are hampered by an inability to safely raise refuse up the steep inclines
                        to the road. A group of senior design students have created a winch-pulled cart and trailer system
                        to assist in removing this trash. Their design was tested on campus and is expected to be implemented
                        to assist summertime cleanup efforts by the Borough.</p>

                    <h2>2018 - Gasification of Biomass to Alleviate Energy Poverty</h2>
                    <p>In Nigera and other parts of the developing world, lack of access to electricity results in a variety
                        of quality of life issues. While electricity in local areas may often be produced using small standalone
                        generators, gasoline to fuel them is very expensive, and presents a significant drain on the local
                        economy. A team of senior design students is working to develop a small scale gasifier that would
                        be suitable to produce a gaseous fuel that could be used to power a typical small electric generator.
                        The gasifier could be fed using locally available agricultural wastes and is intended to be inexpensive
                        and easy to use, as a stepping stone to eliminate economic barriers to energy in these developing
                        areas.
