                    <p>Hello! I'm Joe Ranalli and I am a Professor of Engineering and am faculty in the Alternative Energy and Power Generation Engineering program at Penn State Hazleton. I've wanted to teach engineering ever since I was an undergraduate student at Penn State, so every day I come to work, I am living my dream! I've always been an energy researcher, but getting to this point has been a bit of a circuitous journey. 
					</p>
					<p>While pursuing my PhD, I did research related to thermoacoustic combustion instabilities and their impact gas turbine combustion systems. I had a three year postdoctoral appointment at the National Energy Technology Lab (NETL), in Morgantown, WV, where I continued that work and got some experience with advanced combustion imaging techniques. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Since joining Penn State, I shifted my focus to renewable energy systems to complement our program's alternative energy focus. I've worked on a variety of solar energy applications issues, including site planning and assessment, grid integration and soiling. In 2019, I had the opportunity to complete a sabbatical, living in Oldenburg, Germany for six months, where I got to develop my skills in solar energy much more deeply and have since developed work related to solar irradiance variability and identification of PV panels using deep learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm very thankful for the opportunities solar energy research provides me to contribute toward a more sustainable future for the planet, and for the chance to train students who will do the same.
					</p>

					<p>To complement my love of teaching, I also do research related to better educational practices in engineering. I'm especially interested in the ways that interactive experiences (video games!) can enhance teaching and provide experiential learning opportunities for students. One highlight was using Kerbal Space Program to teach the engineering design process in my Introduction to Engineering Design course. I've taught a number of engineering classes at Penn State and have really enjoyed the breadth of material that I've had the chance to explore as an instructor. 
					</p>
					<p>
					In addition to work, I enjoy woodworking, golf, skiing and spending time with my family. I'm also an avid fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Penn State Football.
